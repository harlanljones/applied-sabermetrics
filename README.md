## Code

[src/utils/sqlite_interface.py](src/utils/sqlite_interface.py) utilizes Python's built-in sqlite3 library to  interface with local .db files without servers or additional dependencies. Not necessarily functional, but more so to replicate a production server that discourages destructive actions while maintaining simplicity and sql interactions programmatically.

[src/round_1_hs_pitchers.ipynb](src/round_1_hs_pitchers.ipynb) is used to explore high school pitchers drafted in the first round of the June Amateur Draft. Will be refactored to a .py file in the future.

## Data

[data/raw](data/raw/) contains all externally sourced data. _See [data/raw/README.md](data/raw/) for citations._

[data/sqlite/](data/sqlite/) contains .db files generated by [src/utils/sqlite_interface.py](src/utils/sqlite_interface.py). Available in repository while file sizes are minimal (will be replaced with schema files).

## Limitations

SQLite has dynamic typing, which is uncharacteristic of SQL database systems. A refactor to SQL schema files may entail a migration to MySQL to add explicit type and size definitions.
