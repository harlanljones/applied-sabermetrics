## Code

[src/utils/sqlite_interface.py](src/utils/sqlite_interface.py) utilizes Python's built-in sqlite3 library to programmatically interface with local .db files without additional dependencies. Not necessarily functional, but more so to replicate a production environment that discourages destructive actions while maintaining simplicity.

[src/round_1_hs_pitchers.ipynb](src/round_1_hs_pitchers.ipynb) is used for to explore highschool pitchers drafted in the first round of the June Amateur Draft. Will be refactored to a .py file in the future.

## Data

[data/raw](data/raw/) contains all externally sourced data. _See [data/raw/README.md](data/raw/) for citations._

[data/sqlite/](data/sqlite/) contains .db files generated by [src/utils/sqlite_interface.py](src/utils/sqlite_interface.py). Available in repository while file sizes are minimal (will replace with schema files eventually).
